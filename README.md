## Windborne Systems – Junior Web Developer Application

This project demonstrates a clean, production-style Next.js App Router setup
using Server Actions to submit data directly to an external API.

### Highlights
- Server Actions for secure POST requests
- Graceful loading, success, and error states
- Progressive enhancement (no JS required)
- Minimal dependencies and clear structure

### Why this approach
Calling the API from a Server Action avoids exposing implementation details
to the client while keeping the UI responsive and accessible.
