Windborne Systems – Junior Web Developer Application

This project demonstrates a clean, production-oriented Next.js App Router setup that uses Server Actions to submit application data directly to an external API.

Highlights

Server Actions for secure, server-side POST requests

Clear loading, success, and error states

Progressive enhancement (works without client-side JavaScript)

Minimal dependencies and a focused, readable structure

Why this approach

Submitting data through a Server Action keeps API logic on the server, avoids exposing implementation details to the client, and allows the UI to remain responsive, accessible, and easy to reason ab
